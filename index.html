        <p>His hometown of Smiljan, which was located in Lika also known as the Austo-Hungarian Empire, region of Croatia at the time (modern Croatia today), where 
        he grew up under his mother who was an inventor of household appliances.</p>
        <p>Nikola Telsa was inspired to study voltage and electricity, which was all due to his experiance of petting his cat by 
        seeing and feeiling a static of electricity from his cat to him.</p>
        <p>Electromagnetic induction was a popular topic in science during 1888 and the basis of it was using motion to power items such as trolleys and buldings. They 
        were powered by Tesla's  enginerity of one way currents that use direct contact to power objects. This also led to Tesla developing 
        ideas for a decent AC motor.</p>
        <p>The AC motor was an idea that was getting not traction for Tesla in Europe so he went 
        to New York were he worked under Thomas Edison. Tesla was able to take high voltage and transform it to 
        low voltage so it was not dangerous to have in household appliances. Edison would lose money due to Tesla's discovery, so Edison disagreed to back him, so 
        Tesla quit an started working for George Westinghouse.</p>
        <p>Tesla created and discovered how triangle competing fields of magnetic force would never touch which is now known as AC power
        which led to his next experiment using high frequency being boosted by the Tesla coil which was created in 1891.</p>
        <p> After his death, Tesla's lab was conserved and turned into a musuem and the founders and CEOS of Tesla Motors was tributed to Nikola Tesla for 
        his creation of the AC power transmission and induction motor.
